## Features

- There are a number of public properties you can use to control the appearance of the slider. See ViewController for example. All properties declared in the RangeSlider class.
- The thumbs can be set to circular, rounded or sharp square, or triangle and are built using CoreGraphics and not pictuers.
- The track thickness can be separately set from the view/thumbs height by scaling


### Upcoming features

- more thumb shapes?
- fix the problem with non-circular  thumbs not completely covering the ends of the track.
- there are likely a number of range checks on properties that need to be done in order for the class to be more crash proof.


### Installation

Just copy the RangeSlider*.swift files into your project.
See the ViewController.swift file for an example on how to use.
You can also just download and build this project as it is.


### Properties - default values

var minimumValue: Double = 0.0

var maximumValue: Double = 1.0

var lowerValue: Double = 0.2        // current slider value for lower thumb

var upperValue: Double = 0.8       // current slider value for lower thumb

var trackTintColor: UIColor = UIColor(white: 0.9, alpha: 1.0)

var trackHighlightTintColor: UIColor = UIColor(red: 0.0, green: 0.45, blue: 0.94, alpha: 1.0) {

var thumbTintColor: UIColor = UIColor.white {

var thumbType = 0                      // e.g. number of corners:  0 = circle , 3 = triangle, 4 = square

var trackSizeScale: CGFloat = 1.0   // to force track size relative to thumbs

var curvaceousness: CGFloat = 1.0       // controls the radius on circular thums and the track ends. A lower value will give shaper corners so the circle will turn into a rounded square.
